# FinalProject For Advanced Python
# Christopher Brandt, Nate Barnaik, Rhianon Hoisington 
# Description: Our final project is a web application that utilizes Flask, MongoDB, and TMDB. It allows the user to search the TMDB database for information about different movies and add them to a list of favorite movies thats stored in MongoDB.
# Self Grade: 8.5/10 
# Self Grade Reasoning: We gave ourselves a self grade of 8.5/10 because our web app functions well, and does a good job integrating MongoDB, TMDB, and Flask. Along with this we also included testing using Pytest, that can be ran using Makefile commands. However, we could have integrated MongoDB more and made more test cases for our main program.
